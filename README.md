### In this deep learning project, we will recognize handwritten characters, i.e., English alphabets from A-Z. This we are going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets. CNN stands for ‘Convolutional Neural Networks’ that are used to extract the features of the images using several layers of filters. The scope of this project is to use as a learning application, we can create an application of handwritten to digital text, we also use this application in bank.
